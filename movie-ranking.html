<h1>Movie Rankings by Shea</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Harry Potter Series</h3></li>
            <p>These are my favorite movies of all time!...They are also my favorite books of all time! I can still watch these movies now and feel like I have gone home to Hogwarts every time.</p>
        <li><h3>The OG Mean Girls</h3></li>
            <p>It's not October 3rd, but any day of the year is a great day for a fetch Mean Girls Quote. By the way, there's an 80% chance it's already raining.</p>
        <li><h3>Legally Blonde Series</h3></li>
            <p>This is such an empowering movie for women. Most people don't understand how incedible this film is, but if you really look at it and take it seriously you will find it's true gold on film.</p>
        <li><h3>The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit Series</h3></li>
            <p>These movie are still some of the most terrifying, yet exillartating films I have ever seen. True adventure lays in the pages of these books and they are brought to life in the films.</p>
        <li><h3>It's a Wonderful Life</h3></li>
            <p>I watch this film every year for Christmas. My husband doesn't understand how I can watch a film that has such poor quality, lasts three hours, and it isn't even in color, but I love the story and every year it puts me in the Christmas spirit. It truly is the greatest way to remind yourself what really matters at the end of the year.</p>
